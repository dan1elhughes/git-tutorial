# Agenda

### Building a commit
### Branching
### Merging
### Collaborating
### Rewriting history
### Cheat sheet

???

- These are the components of Git Flow

# Building a commit

![](https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/getting-started/saving-changes/01.svg)

- `git add` to add a file to staging
- `git commit` to create a commit from the contents of staging

- In HG, you mark a file as being part of the next commit. If the source file changes then the contents of the next commit changes.

???

- Allows you to make many unrelated changes in many or even a single file, and still have atomic commits

---

# Branching

![](https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/using-branches/hero.svg)

- `git branch` to list branches
- `git branch feature-foobar` to create a new branch
- `git checkout feature-foobar` to select a branch
- `git branch -d feature-foobar` to delete a branch

???

- In gitflow, everything should be done in a branch with a pull request, no matter how small.
- Branches are cheap and not designed to last a long time
- `git branch feature-foobar` does not check out the branch, because branches are just pointers

???

- In `hg`, this would create a new commit. In `git` it creates a marker
- We still need to checkout the branch and create some commits on it
