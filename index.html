# Getting started with Git

# Agenda

### Building a commit
### Branching
### Merging
### Collaborating
### Rewriting history
### Cheat sheet

???

- These are the components of Git Flow

---

# Building a commit

![](https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/getting-started/saving-changes/01.svg)

- `git add` to add a file to staging
- `git commit` to create a commit from the contents of staging

- In HG, you mark a file as being part of the next commit. If the source file changes then the contents of the next commit changes.

???

- Allows you to make many unrelated changes in many or even a single file, and still have atomic commits

---

# Branching

![](https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/using-branches/hero.svg)

- `git branch` to list branches
- `git branch feature-foobar` to create a new branch
- `git checkout feature-foobar` to select a branch
- `git branch -d feature-foobar` to delete a branch

???

- In gitflow, everything should be done in a branch with a pull request, no matter how small.
- Branches are cheap and not designed to last a long time
- `git branch feature-foobar` does not check out the branch, because branches are just pointers

---

???

- In `hg`, this would create a new commit. In `git` it creates a marker
- We still need to checkout the branch and create some commits on it

---

# Merging

- Standard merge
- Fast-forward merge

---

## Standard merge

![](http://pic002.cnblogs.com/images/2012/407713/2012081915204638.png)

???

- When to use: When merging pull requests, a "symbolic" merge.

---

## Fast-forward merge

![](http://pic002.cnblogs.com/images/2012/407713/2012081915245240.png)

- Because branches are pointers, we can simply move the pointer

???

- When to use: When integrating someone elses work on the same feature

---

# Merging

- Git will decide the type of merge automatically; if there's no point creating a merge commit, it won't
- It's possible to force a merge commit with `--no-ff`:

---

## Fixing merge conflicts

- See "Building a commit" above!
- The exact same edit, stage, commit workflow:
	- Edit the conflicted file
	- `git add file`
	- `git commit 'Resolve merge conflicts'`
