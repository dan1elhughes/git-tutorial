# Getting started with Git

Dan Hughes, JavaScript Developer

1st July 2016

???

- Building a commit
- Branching
- Merging
- Collaborating
- Rewriting history
- Cheat sheet
- These are the components of Git Flow

---

# Building a commit

![](https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/getting-started/saving-changes/01.svg)

- `git add` to add a file to staging
- `git commit` to create a commit from the contents of staging

- In HG, you mark a file as being part of the next commit. If the source file changes then the contents of the next commit changes.

???

- Git has three states that a file can be in: Modified, Staged, Committed.
- Process:
	- You modify files in your working directory
	- You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area
	- You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git repository
- Allows you to make many unrelated changes in many or even a single file, and still have atomic commits

---

# Branching

![](https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/using-branches/hero.svg)

- `git branch` to list branches
- `git branch feature-foobar` to create a new branch
- `git checkout feature-foobar` to select a branch
- `git branch -d feature-foobar` to delete a branch

???

- In gitflow, everything should be done in a branch with a pull request, no matter how small.
- Branches are cheap and not designed to last a long time
- `git branch feature-foobar` does not check out the branch, because branches are just pointers

---

## Branches are just pointers

---

## Branches are just pointers

![](https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/using-branches/03.svg)

???

- In `hg`, this would create a new commit. In `git` it creates a marker
- We still need to checkout the branch and create some commits on it
- Once we've done some work on this branch and made some commits on it, we'll need to merge it back in

---

# Merging

- Standard merge
- Fast-forward merge
- Merges should always be **meaningful**

???

- The two types of merge

---

## Standard merge

![](http://pic002.cnblogs.com/images/2012/407713/2012081915204638.png)

???

- When to use: When merging pull requests, integrating two indepentant lines of developmont, a "symbolic" merge.

---

## Fast-forward merge

![](http://pic002.cnblogs.com/images/2012/407713/2012081915245240.png)

- Because branches are pointers, we can simply move the pointer

???

- When to use: Whenever possible, as it keeps the project history clean. We only want to create a merge commit when we're _actually_ combining two lines of development
- It's the git default

---

# Merging

- Git will decide the type of merge automatically; if there's no point creating a merge commit, it won't
- It's possible to force a merge commit with `--no-ff`:

![](http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/images/Git/Fast_Forward_Merge/FastForwardMergeWith_no_ff.png)

???

- When to use: When a feature branch is finished and no new work has happened on the main branch, but we still want to log that this is a new feature
- As feature branches are merged by the server, it's very unlikely we will run this command

---

## Fixing merge conflicts

- See "Building a commit" above!
- The exact same edit, stage, commit workflow:
	- Edit the conflicted file
	- `git add file`
	- `git commit 'Resolve merge conflicts'`

---

# Collaborating (`pull` and `push`)

- `git pull` is actually *two* commands:
	- `git fetch` to update our cache of the remote branch
	- `git merge` to merge remote branch into our own

- `git push` sends our commits to the remote and triggers it to perform a fast-forward merge.
	- Fails if it needs a merge commit

???

- We don't want merge commits on pull, as it's not a logical merge of two features.
- We don't want merge commits on push, as the server can't work out conflicts
---

## Fetching with `git pull`

- This gives us a non-meaningful merge commit

![](http://code4reference.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/git-pull.jpg)

???

- Creates a new commit from the most recent local commit combined with the most recent remote commit
- Having branching history on a single branch makes it harder to trace back bugs

---

## Fetching with `git pull --rebase`

- This gives us a linear history

![](http://code4reference.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/git-pull-rebase.jpg)

???

- We can now step back through the commits one at a time continuously to track down the source of a bug

---

## Fetching with `git pull --rebase`

- Another way to view it:

![](https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/articles/trust-the-merge-and-branch-simplification-musings/rebase-on-feature1.gif)

---

## Fetching with `git pull --rebase`

- â€œI want to put my changes on top of what anybody else has done.â€
- This is so common that there's a built-in setting to make it default:
	- `git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always`
	- SourceTree -> Tools -> Options -> Git -> Use rebase instead of merge

---

## Pushing with `git push`

- Opposite of `git fetch`, the server runs `git merge` for us
- **Must** be a fast-forward merge on the server side

--
- .. Except if you ask it nicely with `--force`. This can **delete** commits.
- Only allowed on feature branches, and still need to be careful

???

- Can delete commits because you are overwriting the entire remote, even if someone else pushed commits after you started work

---

# Rewriting history

- Amending mistakes in the last commit
- Incorporating dev commits into feature branch
- Tidying up a feature branch for a pull request

#### Only rewrite commits that haven't been pushed!

- Rewriting changes the internal tree structure and will break the repository of anyone who pulled between the original push and the rewritten push.

---

## `git commit --amend`

- Squash my most recent commit together with the current stage
- Asks for a commit message
- Usage:
	- Forgotten files
	- Mis-typed commit messages

---

## Rebasing

- Moving the base commit of a branch (to maintain a linear project history)

![](https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/getting-started/rewriting-history/02.svg)

---

## Interactive rebasing

- Complete freedom over project history
- Commit a messy history as you work, rewrite it to a clean history later
- To everybody else, it will look like the entire feature was developed in a single series of well-planned commits

---

## Interactive rebasing

```
pick 32618c4 Implement feature
pick 62eed47 Fix something from the previous commit
```

...

```
pick 32618c4 Implement feature
squash 62eed47 Fix something from the previous commit
```

- Demo?
- Have talked about:
	- Building a commit
	- Branching
	- Merging
	- Collaborating
	- Rewriting history
- The result of all of that.. (next slide)

---

# The result

![](http://www.bitsnbites.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1-nonlinear-vs-linear.png)

???

- Every commit is atomic
- Every merge is meaningful
- Every commit on dev is a new feature
- Easy to step back through the history and find the source of bugs
	- There's actually an automated tool for this, `git bisect`
- Rebasing isn't scary, but needs practise
- Interactive rebasing is kinda scary but highly recommended for creating a clean history

---
